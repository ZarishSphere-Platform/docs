## About Zarish Sphere

The Zarish Sphere Platform is an enterprise-grade, distributed system designed to manage the full spectrum of operations for a global non-profit development organization. It serves as a unified digital ecosystem, replacing fragmented monolithic systems with a modern, modular, and flexible architecture.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the documentation, we recommend starting with the [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md) to understand the platform's high-level design, followed by the [Core Principles](guides/core-principles.md) to grasp the foundational philosophies.

For developers and system administrators, the [Deployment Guide](deployment/guide.md) provides detailed instructions on setting up and deploying the platform.
