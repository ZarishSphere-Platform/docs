We welcome contributions to the Zarish Sphere Platform documentation! High-quality documentation is crucial for the success and usability of our platform. Please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and clarity.

## Getting Started

3.  **Set Up Upstream Remote:** Add the original repository as an upstream remote to stay updated with the latest changes:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ZarishSphere-Platform/docs.git
    ```

## Making Changes

    ```bash
    git checkout -b doc/your-doc-topic
    ```
2.  **Markdown Format:** All documentation should be written in Markdown (`.md`) format. Follow standard Markdown syntax for headings, lists, code blocks, and links.
